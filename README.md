ImagePaste
==========

An attempt to troubleshoot issues with the original package- 

âšª Fix Proper Path Reference

The path reference doesn't work exactly when the file name or the directory has a space in their name. In the original package, the directory and file name doesn't use spaces in their name.

# Installation (Not Recommended)

Installation is not recommended at this moment. But the process is - 

Through Package Control:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Package Control: Add Repository` -> `https://github.com/anyfactor/imagepaste`

Then:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Package Control: Install Package` -> `imagepaste` || Find the one with the **anyfactor** one.

# Goal

Make this package more like this VSCode plugin: [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)
